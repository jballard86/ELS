/*
Calculate the X/Y coords by using sine cosine
store the result in an array
the total number of array positions equals the amount of steps to take, this should be a user input
calculate the arrays before starting the spindle
have the user place the tool on the end of the work, tool position will create an origin of x == r and y == -radius

user input: steps, radius, depth of cut
